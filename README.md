# Music Room
[Music Room](http://musicroom.cc) is a collaborative music project in its inception phase. It aims to build a platform to allow people to play music over the internet. There's no fixed course of action as of right now, so suggestions are welcome (very welcome, I have no idea what I'm doing).

# Current development
The available prototype provides a very simple synthesizer to be played by multiple people at the same time, with a lot of latency.

Toolkit being used:
- Node.js
- Express, Socket.io
- WebAudio API

## Good project for beginners
I hope that people who are just starting with open source code (like me) will participate and contribute, since the current architecture is very simple and there's nothing too complex to work with. If you like web development, music, or cool games, this might be a good start. If you're more experienced, you can act as a guide and help others.

## Ideas for the future
- Develop/Implement a good communication protocol to have our instruments be broadcast to everyone consistently.
- Implement various instruments that you can choose.
- Create 'rooms' you can join (and limit the number of people playing at the same time).
